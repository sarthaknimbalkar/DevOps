*To fully automate this script, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Set Up a Cron Job (Linux/MacOS)**
You can schedule this script to run automatically at specified intervals using `cron`. Here’s how to do it:

1. **Edit the cron table**:
   Run the following command:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. **Schedule the script**:
   Add a new cron job entry to run your script automatically. For example, to run the script daily at 7 AM, add:
   ```bash
   0 7 * * * resource_tracker.sh >> /path/to/logfile.log 2>&1
   ```
   The cron job format is:
   ```
   minute hour day_of_month month day_of_week command
   ```

3. **Save and exit** the editor.

This will run the script automatically and log the output to the specified logfile.

### 2. **Set Up a Scheduled Task (Windows)**
I am using Windows, if you're also using Windows, you can use the Task Scheduler:

1. Open **Task Scheduler**.
2. Click on **Create Basic Task**.
3. Follow the wizard to schedule your script:
   - Choose a name and description.
   - Set the trigger (e.g., daily).
   - Choose the action to **Start a Program**.
   - Browse to the script and select it.
4. Finish the wizard and confirm the task is working.

### 3. **Automating Notifications**
You can enhance automation by setting up notifications (e.g., email, Slack, etc.) after the script runs. Here’s how:

#### **Email Notifications (using `mail` command):**
At the end of your script, add:
```bash
mail -s "AWS Usage Report" youremail@example.com < /path/to/logfile.log
```

#### **Slack Notifications:**
You can send a message to a Slack channel using an incoming webhook. Add this to your script:
```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data '{"text":"AWS Usage Report: Check the attached logs."}' https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url
```

### 4. **Store Output to S3 (Not necessary really)**
If you also want to keep logs of the report in an S3 bucket:
```bash
aws s3 cp /path/to/logfile.log s3://your-bucket-name/aws-reports/$(date +%F)-usage-report.log
```

### 5. **Add Execution Permissions**
Ensure the script has execute permissions:
```bash
chmod +x resource_tracker.sh
```

By scheduling the script with `cron` or another task scheduler, and optionally adding notifications, your AWS usage report will be generated and delivered automatically.**

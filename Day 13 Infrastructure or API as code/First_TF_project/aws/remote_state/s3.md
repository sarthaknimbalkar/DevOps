## S3 Backend for Terraform

**Source:** Adapted from [terraform-best-practices](https://github.com/ozbillwang/terraform-best-practices).

### Overview

This guide walks you through creating an S3 bucket and a DynamoDB table to serve as the backend for storing Terraform state files and handling state locking.

### Resources

- **DynamoDB Table Name:** `terraform-lock`
- **S3 Bucket Name:** `<account_id>-terraform-states`

### Setup

1. **Create the S3 Bucket and DynamoDB Table**

   Ensure that the following resources are created in the specified AWS account:

   - **S3 Bucket**: Used for storing the Terraform state files.
   - **DynamoDB Table**: Used for managing state locks to prevent simultaneous updates.

2. **Usage**

   Follow the steps below to initialize and apply your Terraform configurations using the S3 backend.

### Steps

```bash
# Ensure you are on the correct AWS account
pip install awscli

# List your S3 buckets to confirm access
aws s3 ls

# If the default region is not set in your AWS configuration, export the region manually
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# Dry-run to check what changes will be made
terraform init
terraform plan

# Apply the changes to create resources or update the infrastructure
terraform apply
```

### Key Points:

- **AWS CLI**: Ensure that the AWS CLI is installed and configured on your local machine. The commands `aws s3 ls` and `aws configure` can help verify your AWS credentials and region settings.
  
- **Region Configuration**: If your AWS default region is not set or differs from the desired region for resource creation, use `export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1` to explicitly define it.

- **Terraform Commands**:
  - **`terraform init`**: Initializes the Terraform working directory, setting up the backend configuration.
  - **`terraform plan`**: Provides a preview of the actions that Terraform will take.
  - **`terraform apply`**: Executes the actions required to reach the desired state of the configuration.

### Additional Tips:

- **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Use environment-specific backend and variable files (`dev`, `prod`, etc.) to manage different environments efficiently.
  
- **IAM Permissions**: Ensure that the IAM role or user running these commands has the necessary permissions to create and manage S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, and other resources as required.

This structured approach helps ensure that your Terraform state management is robust, secure, and scalable across different environments.
